## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project we learn how to use flexbox to change de order and organization of the elements in a web site and how to use filters in images.

```css
img {
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  filter: opacity(0.6) drop-shadow(0 0 0 rgb(127, 9, 201));
  max-width: 100%;
  height: 410px;
  padding-bottom: 40px;
}
```


### Continued development

We need to continue learning about how flexbox works.

### Useful resources
